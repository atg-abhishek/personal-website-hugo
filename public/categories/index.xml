 Machine Learning Engineer, Microsoft on the Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team at Microsoft where I work on machine learning projects involving both Azure ML services and open-source implementations. The hallmarks of the CSE team are that we operate in a “code-with” model with our customers. The team is deeply technical and highly specialized in solving the toughest technical challenges faced by Microsoft’s customers and the team follows an open-sourcing model to contribute the code and insights to the community from our engagements.</description>

Primary areas of research focus:  ML Retrospectives - a novel approach to making machine learning research transparent and accessible to colleagues in the scientific community. An emphasis on being retrospective about prior work and being comfortable with mistakes, transforming them into stepping stones for further scientific endeavours. For more information, please take a look here. This idea has been hosted as workshops at NeurIPS 2019, ICML 2020, and will be hosted at NeurIPS 2020.</description>
