## Areas of research, application and community engagement 

* I founded the **[Montreal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai)** with the vision of creating tangible and practical research in the ethical, safe and inclusive development of AI. See the link for more details - Montreal AI Ethics Institute
* I founded the **[meetup group on AI Ethics](https://montrealethics.ai/meetup)** in Montreal that meets once every two weeks to do a deep dive on different aspects of the ethical development of AI. We also work together as a community to provide feedback and recommendations to public documents like the Montreal Ethical AI Declaration. The group consists of members with diverse backgrounds like computer science, law, sociology, business, policy, etc.
* **Labor shifts**: Labor impacts of AI-enabled automation in the financial services industry in Canada.
* **AI Ethics in Education**: Introductory curriculum via a 4-part workshop series to introduce the topic of the ethical development of AI to students, faculty, staff and alumni of the McGill community.
* **AI Ethics in Medicine**: Informed consent and its ethical implications in the field of medicine, especially when AI-enabled solutions are used in diagnosis and clinical trials.
* **Mission-driven AI**: research on how non-profits, social enterprises and NGOs can leverage machine learning solutions to help them stretch their donation dollars further by scaling the work that they do and increasing efficiency of their operations
* **Social inclusion in AI**: Technical and policy approaches to increase social inclusion in the entire pipeline of AI - from design and conception, data collection and use all the way to the end-of-life management of a project.
* **AI and Law**: Legal and ethical implications with the increasing use of AI in the context of emerging privacy and data security laws like the GDPR

*If any one of the above areas interest you or you're interested in collaborating on the intersection of AI with another field and exploring its ethical implications, feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:abhishek@montrealethics.ai) or any other channel as linked in the bottom section.*
