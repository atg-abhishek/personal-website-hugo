## Current affiliations

* **Founder, [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai)** and a **principal investigator** for several [projects](https://montrealethics.ai/about/) happening at the Montreal AI Ethics Institute.

* **Machine Learning Engineer, Microsoft** on the Commercial Software Engineering (CSE) team at Microsoft where I work on machine learning projects involving both Azure ML services and open-source implementations. The hallmarks of the CSE team are that we operate in a “code-with” model with our customers. The team is deeply technical and highly specialized in solving the toughest technical challenges faced by Microsoft’s customers and the team follows an open-sourcing model to contribute the code and insights to the community from our engagements. 

* **Board Member, Responsible AI board for CSE, Microsoft** and through my involvement in serving on this board, I have exposure to applied projects across a variety of industries where a lot of these issues emerge. I have been a part of developing and implementing actionable guidance for developers and other stakeholders like designers, business managers, and others so that they can make informed decisions that align with the values and objectives of the organization.

* **Chair, Standards Working Group, Green Software Foundation** working on creating industry-wide consensus on methodology and tooling to assess the environmental impacts of software systems. 

* **Technical Expert, Council of Canadian Academies** on the legal, ethical, social, and policy issues in the use of AI for science and engineering.

* **Founding Editorial Board Member, Springer Journal on AI and Ethics** journal aimed at bringing together theoretical and practical scholarship in the field of AI ethics. 

* **Board Member, AI Advisory Board, Dawson College** helping the college shape its 5-year educational plan to incorporate AI meaningfully into the curriculum such that students are equipped for the future of work. Also, emphasizing for a focus on integrating the ethical, safe, and inclusive development of AI as a core tenet in the AI skill development process.

* **Associate Member, LF AI Foundation, Linux Foundation** bringing AI ethics expertise to the foundation and working on incubating some of the ongoing technical work at MAIEI with the LF AI Foundation to work with other member organizations to build more open-source, open-access tooling in AI ethics.

* **Faculty Associate, Frankfurt Big Data Lab, Goethe University** serving to provide ethics and technical guidance on the Z-inspection project started by Dr. Roberto Zicari.

* **Certification Contributor, Coursera** created several courses in partnership with CertNexus on AI ethics and implementing them in practice. You can see more details [here](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~69850206).

* **AI Ethics Researcher (Technical) and Expert Collaborator, AI Policy Exchange** working on policy and governance issues related to the impacts of AI on society.

* **Global Shaper, World Economic Forum** part of the Montreal Hub and involved with the Responsible AI project that collected feedback from the general public to build an understanding of the layman's grasp of AI and potential ethical concerns that arise from its use.

* **Member, Banff Forum** part of the group bringing an expertise in machine learning and ethics. Also, helping to provide critical commentary for the community on the use of technology in novel circumstances, as an example the use of contact- and proximity-tracing applications to combat COVID-19.

* **AI Ethics Expert, Ethical Intelligence Co.** working with an interdisciplinary experts group in doing fundamental research, hosting workshops, developing curriculum in AI ethics, and working on AI ethics audits for different organizations.
 

My research focuses on applied technical and policy methods to address ethical, safety and inclusivity concerns in using AI in different domains. I have built the largest community driven, public consultation group on AI Ethics in the world that has made significant contributions to the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, the G7 AI Summit, Australian Human Rights Council and World Economic Forum Responsible Innovation framework, PIPEDA (Canada's privacy law) amendments for AI impacts, Scotland’s national AI strategy and the European Commission Trustworthy AI Guidelines. My work on public competence building in AI Ethics has been recognized by governments from North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. 

My key areas of research focus are listed **[here](https://atg-abhishek.github.io/about/currentwork/)**

*If any one of the above areas interest you or you're interested in collaborating on the intersection of AI with another field and exploring its ethical implications, feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:abhishek@montrealethics.ai) or any other channel as linked in the bottom section.*
